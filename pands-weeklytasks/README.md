# Programming and Scripting: My Weekly Tasks

by Tihana Gray

## Week 02

1. Writing a program called bank.py 
2. Requirement: The program should: Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent); Add the two amounts; Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount 
3. I created a program done in 4 steps:
Step 1: The values are stored in amount1 and amount2. The program prompts the user to enter 2 money amounts in cents, takes the input as a string and converts it into an integer. 
Step 2: The 2 values are added together. The sum is stored in the total_cents variable.
Step 3: Converting cents to euros and formating the output. 
Step 4: Printing the final result (â‚¬2.45)
