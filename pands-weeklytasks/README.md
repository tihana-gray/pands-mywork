## ðŸ“… Week 02

**Task:**

Writing a program called `bank.py`\
Requirement: The program should: Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent); Add the two amounts; Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.

### Steps:
1. **Input Handling:**
- The values are stored in amount1 and amount2. The program prompts the user to enter 2 money amounts in cents, takes the input as a string and converts it into an integer.\
`input()` is used to take user input as a string.\
`int()` converts the input into an integer because it needs a numerical value.\

- https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int

2. **Adding the Values:** 
- The 2 values are added together. The sum is stored in the total_cents variable.\

3. **Formatting as Euros:** 
- Converting cents to euros and formating the output. 
The total cents are converted to euros by dividing by 100. The result is formatted to two decimal places using an f-string to get the right currency format.\

## ðŸ“… Week 03

This Python program masks account numbers by replacing all but the last four digits with 'X'.\
It consists of two versions:\
- First Version: Handles exactly 10-digit account numbers, masking the first six digits and showing only the last four.
- Updated Version: Supports account numbers of any length, masking all but the last four digits.

### How it works:

1. **User Input:**
- Using `input()` function to prompt the account number. It also converts it to a string.

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45229343/program-in-python-that-will-prompt-the-user-to-enter-an-account-number-consists

2. **Validating input length:**
- Making sure that the length of input is exactly 10 characters.\
ðŸ“š Source: 
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len
- https://realpython.com/len-python-function/

3. **Masking:**
- Used string slicing to extract the last 4 characters and used `rjust()` to pad the masked number.\

- https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_rjust.asp
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-rjust-method

### Extra:

1. Using `len()` to return the numbers in the string. Built in function `>` ensures that the number is larger than 4. 
2. Creating a masked version that replacing all but the last 4 characters.
3. If the account number is 4 or less characters it displays error message.\

## ðŸ“… Week 04

Writing a program, called `collatz.py`, that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.\
At each step calculates the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, dividing it by two, but if it is odd, multiplying it by three and adding one.\
The program ends if the current value is one.

1. **Colatz:**
- A function is defined as `collatz` that takes a single parameter `n`, defined with using `def` keyword.\
ðŸ“š Source: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp

2. **Loop:**
- The while loop `while n != 1` executes as long as `n != 1` is `True`. It runs until `n` becomes 1.\
ðŸ“š Source: 
- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp
- https://realpython.com/python-while-loop/

3. **Value:**
- The value `n` is printed `print(n, end=" ")` followed by space to keep the output in the same line.\
ðŸ“š Source: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp

4. **Conditions:**
- An `if` statement is used to check if `n` is even or odd:\
  if even: `n % 2 == 0` that means `n` is divided by 2 using integer division `//` ensuring the result is integer.\
  else (if odd): `n` is multiplied by 3 and added 1.\
ðŸ“š Source: 
- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp
- https://realpython.com/python-while-loop/
- The loop exits when `n` is 1, the final value of `n` is printed.

### User Input:
- User input is a positive integer. The `input()` function reads a line from input and the converts to integer `int()`\
ðŸ“š Source: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp
- If the integer is positive, it refers to `collatz` function. If not, the user is prompted to enter a positive integer.\
ðŸ“š Source: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp
- Exception `except` is added to block potential errors with different values. if `ValueError` occurs, the user is prompted
to enter a positive integer.\

## ðŸ“… Week 05

Writing a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.

1. **Datetime:**
- First the `datetime` modul is imported. It is needed to show the current day.\
ðŸ“š Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html

2. **Tuple:**
- Next, `weekdays` tuple is set to contain names of working days and 'weekends` tuple is for weekend days.\

- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp
- https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_tuple.asp
- https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-tuples-tutorial

3. **Dictionary:**
- Dictionary mapping helps adding numbers to day names. Integers are created for each weekdays, further creating a loop using numbers as keys.\
ðŸ“š Source: 
- https://realpython.com/python-dicts/
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36341484/get-day-name-from-weekday-int

4. **Weekday function:**
- The `datetime.now().weekday()` function is used to return the integer value corresponding to the specified day of the week.\
ðŸ“š Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/weekday-function-of-datetime-date-class-in-python/

5. **Conversion:**
- Next step retrieves the day name from `day_map` using the integer from `weekday()` to convert numbers into words.\

## ðŸ“… Week 06

Writing a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

1. **Start:**
- `def sqrt(number):`is used to calculate the square root of a given number.
- `guess = number / 2`starts with the initial guess for the square root by dividing the number by 2.
- `tolerance = 0.00001`sets the precision.\
ðŸ“š Source: https://realpython.com/python-square-root-function/\

2. **Loop:**
- ` while abs(guess * guess - number) > tolerance:` Loop until the square of the guess is close enough to the original number. `abs()` gives the absolute value.\
- `guess = (guess + number / guess) / 2` improves the guess by averaging it with the division result.\

- https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35858135/guessing-number-game-python

3. **Defining the function:**
- `def main():` defines the main() function.
ðŸ“š Source: https://realpython.com/python-main-function/

4. **Errors and exceptions:**
- `try:` used to catch errors.
- `number = float(input("Please enter a positive number: "))` prompts the user for input and converts it to a float.
- `if number <= 0:` checks that the number is greater than zero. Square roots of zero or negative numbers aren't valid.
- `print("Number must be positive.")` prints an error message if the number is not valid.
- `return` stop the program early by returning from the function.
- `result = sqrt(number)` using custom `sqrt` function to calculate the square root.
- `print(f"The square root of {number} is approx. {result:.1f}")` prints the result using an f-string and rounds it to 1 decimal place.
- `except ValueError:` prevents invalid inputs that can't be converted into a float.
- `print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")` informs the user if the input is invalid.\

- https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_float.asp#:~:text=Definition%20and%20Usage,into%20a%20floating%20point%20number.\


5. **Final stage:**
- `if __name__ == "__main__":` ensures that main() is only run if the script is executed directly, not imported.
- `main()` calls the `main()` function to start the program.

## ðŸ“… Week 07

Writing a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains.

1. **Reading the filename from the command line**
- Importing the necessary modules.
- `sys` allows the script to access command-line arguments (like the filename).
- `os` provides a way to interact with the file system, like checking if a file exists.\
ðŸ“š Source: 
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.isfile

2. **Defining the function**
- `count_es()` function opens the file safely using a `with open()`.
- Reads the entire content of the file into a string.
- Uses `.count('e')` to count how many times lowercase e appears.\
ðŸ“š Source: 
- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_handling.asp
- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_handling.asp

3. **Further defining**
- `def main()` checks if the filename is provided. If not, shows an error message and exits.
- `if len(sys.argv) < 2` and `sys.exit` make sure that the program doesn't crash if `sys.argv[1]`is missing.\
ðŸ“š Source: 
- https://realpython.com/python-command-line-arguments/
- https://realpython.com/python-main-function/

4. **Storing and validating the filename**
- `sys.argv[1]` contains any and all Python command-line arguments passed to the program.
- `filename = sys.argv[1]` extracts the filename and checks if the file is in the folder.
- ' if not filename.endswith(".txt")` checks that the file has the right extension.\
ðŸ“š Source: 
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.isfile
- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_handling.asp
- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_open.asp

5. **Reading the file**
`    try:
        print(count_es(filename))
    except Exception as e:
        sys.exit(f"Error reading file: {e}")`
- Implements the `count_es()` function.
- Prints the number of e's.
- Scans for errors.

- https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/
- https://realpython.com/python-built-in-exceptions/
- https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html

6. **Program execution**
- This step ensures that the script only runs `main()` if it is run directly (not imported as a module).
- Also prevents execution when the file is imported elsewhere.

**Extra:**
- I found the "Moby Dick" text file on Google.
ðŸ“š Source: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701
- I downloaded the "Plain Text UTF-8" file and renamed it into `moby-dick.txt`
- Placed it in the same folder with the working file `es.py`
