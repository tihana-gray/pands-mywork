# Messing with while loops
# Author: Tihana Gray

#while condition:
#    statements
#
# two types
#   Counter Controled
#       we usualy use for loops for counter conttroled loops
#   Sentinal Controled
#       if you are reading in from a user, one pattern is
#       read in from the user, check the while, and then read again in the 
#       body of the while loop
# be careful of infinite loops
#   make sure you modify what you are checking

count = 10
while count >=0:
    print ("countdown ", count)
    count -= 1
print("blast off")
